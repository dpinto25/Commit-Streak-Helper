# Hey everyone! As I'm learning python, and I forgot to do a commit yesterday breaking my green square streak, I decided to solve this problem! 

# This is a simple script that will take a file, copy it a few times and commit the changes to github once every 24 hours.

# In a perfect world, you can even run this on any server (No I'm not trying to steal your damn data, just read the source code) and you won't need to leave your PC running.

# Feel free to use it, please no repost as if you made it :(
